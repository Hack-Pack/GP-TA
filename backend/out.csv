1,Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15,"2x = 10, x = 10 / 2, x = 5","2x = 10, x = 10 / 2, x = 5"
2,Find the roots of the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0,"x^2 - 2x - 3x - 6, x(x - 2) + 3(x - 2), (x + 3)(x - 2), roots of the equation are -3 and 2","x^2 - 2x - 3x + 6, x(x - 2) - 3(x - 2), (x - 3)(x - 2), roots of the equation are 3 and 2"
3,"If f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1, find f(2).","3(2^2) - 2(2) + 1, 12 - 4 + 1, 9","3(2)^2 - 2(2) + 1, 12 - 4 + 1, 9"
4,Simplify the expression 2x^2 - 8 / x - 2,"2x^2 - 8 / 2x - 8, (2x^2 / 2x) + (8 / 8), x + 1","2(x^2 - 4) / (x - 2), 2((x + 2)(x - 2)) / (x - 2), 2x + 4"
