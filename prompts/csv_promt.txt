Examine the scanned image of the exam paper closely and identify the question numbers, the questions themselves, and the sequence of solutions, which includes all the intermediary steps taken by the student. Format your response as a json object, with the question number serving as the key. Within this object, the question text should be the key for a string that contains each step (separated by commas) leading to the final solution.

For instance, if the image depicts 'Q1: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15' with the student's working steps '2x = 10', 'x = 10 / 2', and the final solution 'x = 5', then you should present your output as follows:
```
{
  "Q1": {
    "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15": "2x = 10, x = 10 / 2, x = 5"
  }
}
```
Ensure that you transcribe all text and mathematical expressions with precision from the image and structure the information as indicated. The questions and their respective solutions must be exactly as they are displayed on the exam paper, including the numbering of the questions.
